# Hello!

We are Xever.

## Our Mission

- For the widespread adoption and "de-complication" of the Linux desktop, and removing the stigma of the Linux platform being a "complicated, enthusiast-only platform".
- Provide affordable utilities along with enhancements to the general public, and potentially even providing these utilities free of cost.
